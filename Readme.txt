*Deleting CustomerIndo_Perm not recommended


I made this Bank Management system for a school project. Feel free to use it.

This is a completely unique project, you may not able to find any other Bank Management System that uses Binary files to save the data.

Feel free to check over youtube, only projects there are using a DBMS software. But this project uses a Binary file to save the data,

so it could fetch you some extra marks if you are using this code for a school/college project.

-- Fuctions --

~ Admin functions: view all accounts, delete account, update/modify account, or get information of a particular account

~ Customer functions: View bank balance, add money, withdraw money and send money in someone else account

~ Data get stored in binary file instead of DBMS

-- How to use --

~ First save all the files in one folder.

~ After you have stored all these files, run main file on any software (Just not on IDLE)

~ To access Admin menu enter username: Admin and password: Admin (can be changed)

~ There are time gaps in-between to make it a little more realistic, you can remove those if needed.
